# Hi, I'm Lucas!

I'm a university student studying actuarial science with a passion for data analysis and machine learning. My main programming language is Python, and I also have experience using SAS and SQL. I'm proficient in a variety of Python packages, including:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

I'm always looking to learn new skills and take on new challenges. As an actuarial science student, I'm particularly interested in using data to model and assess risk. I'm excited to continue exploring the possibilities of data analysis and modeling in actuarial science and other real-world applications.

In addition to my work in actuarial science, I'm also interested in web development and software engineering. I'm always seeking out new opportunities to collaborate on interesting projects and expand my skill set.

Thanks for checking out my profile! Feel free to reach out if you're interested in connecting or collaborating on a project.
