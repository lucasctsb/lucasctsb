# Hi there, I'm Lucas! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist with a strong foundation in Statistics and a passion for uncovering insights through Data Science.

Using Python and its core libraries, I analyze complex datasets to extract valuable insights, providing a deeper understanding of patterns and trends. These data-driven analyses serve as the foundation for strategic decision-making and innovative solutions in data science projects.

ðŸ’» Languages: My primary programming language is Python. I also have solid knowledge of SQL and SAS. Recently, I've been practicing C++ to expand my skills in machine learning-focused projects.

ðŸ’¬ Objective: My goal is to combine Statistical expertise with Data Science to develop comprehensive and precise approaches for risk assessment and modeling.

Feel free to connect and collaborate!
